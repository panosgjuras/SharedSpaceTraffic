# "Shared space Traffic" - Coexistence problem

Shared space is an umbrella term which refers to that part of urban road space which all road users (including pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles and disabled people) are encouraged to legally occupy, with little physical or visual separation. It intends to create safer road environments, by adding more danger. This concept is based on the risk homeostasis theory, where humans shift the balance of risk according to the surrounding environment, so that they can coexist. Since shared space is a controversial concept that increase the number and the complexity of interactions among road users, there are intriguing research questions/hypothesis that have not been answered/tested so far. 

#### TWO DATASETS!!!!
This repository contains tools to analyze coexistence in shared space. The analysis is based on two dataset which are publicly available:
Tzouras, P., Kepaptsoglou, K., Vlahogianni, E. I.(2023), “Traffic measurements in Amalias Street. Conventional Road vs Shared Space”, Mendeley Data, V2, doi.org/10.17632/n3wzjd54pj.2


#### HYPOTHESIS
Some of the Research Questions we aim to answer: 
1. Does shared space lead to higher number of crossings?
2. What is the relationship between pedestrian crossing and traffic speeds?
3. What are the differences with a convention road when motorized traffic dominates?

##### CASES WITH AVTIVITY ZONE ETC..
